# Julia interface to Spinnaker cameras

The `SpinnakerCameras` package is to use cameras via the Spinnaker SDK (Software Development Kit).

## Installation

The depency to the the Spinnaker dynamic library must be done by creating a file `deps/deps.jl` in the folder `deps\`. Add this line to the file to locate the library.

```julia
# Path to the dynamic library of the Spinnaker SDK for C code.
const lib = "/opt/spinnaker/lib/libSpinnaker_C.so"
```

## Usage

### System, interface and camera objects

Compared to the Spinnaker SDK for C code, the managment of objects is much
simplified by the Julia interface.  For instance, Spinnaker objects are
automatically released or destroyed when their Julia counterpart is rabage
collected.

To deal with Spinnaker cameras and interfaces, you must first get an instance
of the Spinnaker object system:

```julia
using SpinnakerCameras
system = SpinnakerCameras.System()
```

To retrieve a list of Spinnaker interfaces to which cameras can be connected,
call one of:

```julia
interfaces = system.interfaces
interfaces = SpinnakerCameras.InterfaceList(system)
```

To get a specific interface instance, say the `i`-th one, call one of:

```julia
interface = SpinnakerCameras.Interface(interfaces, i)
interface = interfaces[i]
```

which are completely equivalent.  As you may expect, calling
`length(interfaces)` yields the number of entries in the interface list.  Note
that the indices of Spinnaker interfaces, cameras, enumerations, and nodes are
1-based in Julia.

To retrieve a list of all cameras connected to the system, call one of:

```julia
cameras = system.cameras
cameras = SpinnakerCameras.CameraList(system)
```

To retrieve a list of cameras connected to a given interface, call one of:

```julia
cameras = interface.cameras
cameras = SpinnakerCameras.CameraList(interface)
```

Calling `length(cameras)` yields the number of cameras in the list.

An instance of a specific camera, say the `i`-th one, is given by:

```julia
camera = SpinnakerCameras.Camera(cameras, i)
camera = cameras[i]
```

which are completely equivalent.

Note that you may chain operations.  For instance, you may do:

```julia
camera = system.interfaces[2].cameras[1]
```

to retrieve the 1st camera on the 2nd interface.  Chaining operations however
results in creating temporary objects which are automatically released or destroyed
but which are only used once.

Lists of interfaces and lists of cameras are iterable so you may write:

```julia
for camera in system.cameras
    ...
end
```

to loop over the cameras of the system.


### Images

A Spinnaker image may be created by:

```julia
img = SpinnakerCameras.Image(pixelsformat, (width,height))
```

where `pixelsformat` is an integer specifying the pixel format (see enumeration
`spinImageFileFormat` in header `SpinnakerDefsC.h` for possible values) while
the 2-tuple `(width,height)` specifies the dimensions of the image in pixels.

An image may also be acquired from a camera (streaming acquisition must be
running):

```julia
img = SpinnakerCameras.next_image(camera)
```

which waits forever until a new image is available.  In general it is better to
specify a time limit, for instance:

```julia
secs = 5.0 # maximum number of seconds to wait
img = SpinnakerCameras.next_image(camera, secs)
```

If you want to catch timeout error, the following piece of code yields a result
`img` that is an image if a new image is acquirred before the time limit, or
`nothing` if the time limit is exceeded, and throws an exception otherwise:

```julia
img = try
    SpinnakerCameras.next_image(camera, secs)
catch ex
    if (!isa(ex, SpinnakerCameras.CallError) ||
        ex.code != SpinnakerCameras.SPINNAKER_ERR_TIMEOUT)
        rethrow(ex)
    end
    nothing
end
```

Images implement many properties.  For example:

```julia
img.bitsperpixel     # yields the number of bits per pixel of `img`
img.buffersize       # yields the buffer size of `img`
img.data             # yields the image data of `img`
img.privatedata      # yields the private data of `img`
img.frameid          # yields the frame Id of `img`
img.height           # yields the height of `img`
img.id               # yields the Id of `img`
img.offsetx          # yields the X-offset of `img`
img.offsety          # yields the Y-offset of `img`
img.paddingx         # yields the X-padding of `img`
img.paddingy         # yields the Y-padding of `img`
img.payloadtype      # yields the payload type of `img`
img.pixelformat      # yields the pixel format of `img`
img.pixelformatname  # yields the pixel format name of `img`
img.size             # yields the size of `img` (number of bytes)
img.stride           # yields the stride of `img`
img.timestamp        # yields the timestamp of `img`
img.validpayloadsize # yields the valid payload size of `img`
img.width            # yields the width of `img`
```
